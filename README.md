# CellBench_data
This contains the dataset for comparing scRNA-seq analysis methods

Three human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines HCC827, H1975 and H2228 were cultured separately and the same batch was processed in three different ways. Firstly, the single cells were mixed in equal proportions, with libraries generated using three different protocols: CEL-seq2, Drop-seq with Dolomite equipment and 10X Chromium. Secondly, the single cells were sorted from the three cell lines into 384-well plates, with an equal number of cells per well in different combinations. Thirdly, the RNA were extracted in bulk for each cell line and the RNA was mixed in 7 different proportions and diluted to single cell equivalent amounts.
